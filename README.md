You v Ouy is a singleplayer game in which your objective is to survive as long as possible against... yourself! Each round begins in a circular arena in which you fight against your ghost from the prior round. At the end of each round you are presented with powerups to choose from! Choose wisely however, as progressing too quickly in power means your ghost will too, preventing you from making into later rounds. Ultimately, this is a game of balance.
